# Raspberry Pi Controlled Cat Feeder

This is a very much work-in-progress side project for myself for the year 2018.  This is my first attempt at physical computing. The goal here is to be able to dispense cat food into a dish at automated intervals, or manually by pressing a button.

# Hardware
Currently, this is a mess of wires on my desk, but below is a list of all hardware used right now
 - [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400)
 - [Adafruit 128x64 OLED screen](https://www.adafruit.com/product/938)
 - [FeeTech FS5103R Continuous Rotation Servo](https://www.adafruit.com/product/154)
 - [Zevro KCH-06127 Compact Dry Food Dispenser](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009Q8PZMK/)

# TODO Items
 - Trigger remotely via IFTTT action
 - Trigger remotely via Amazon Echo
 - Display on screen if last feeding was timed or local manual, or remote manual
 - Send webhook when triggered (time and trigger type)
 - Run on schedule
 - Start script on boot
 - List all needed python dependencies in the readme
